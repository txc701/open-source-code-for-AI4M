## Overview

This project is part of a journal focused on mathematical formalization and theorem proving, leveraging Lean 4 as a tool for precise and verifiable mathematical reasoning. The repository covers a variety of topics, including (but not limited to):

- **Abstract Algebra**: Formalized treatments of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
- **Mathematical Olympiads**: Problem-solving techniques and solutions to challenging problems from the Mathematical Olympiads, formalized using Lean.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning and applying Lean 4 to formalize mathematical proofs and solve problems in different fields.
